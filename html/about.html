      <p>Hello, my name is Leslie Morales. I am a recent computer science graduate from Cal State East Bay.  I am detail-oriented with a desire to always learn and expand upon my current skills. I take particular interest in full-stack web development and working with user interfaces. My academic experience has allowed me to work with HTML/CSS, JS, Node and Express to create interactive sites. I also have basic experience with Android Studio in Java to create simple apps. I would say I have an artistic eye that enables me to enjoy working with design and another part of me that enjoys bringing it to life.

      <br>
        In my spare time, I really enjoy drawing, playing video games, listening to music, and practicing cello. I'm also an avid fan of animated series so when I have the time I like to catch up on my favorites or start a new one..</p>
